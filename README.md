# SCIMAS-Smart-Comfort-Index-Monitoring-Alert-System

An IoT-driven environmental monitoring and alert system designed to enhance workplace comfort and safety in industrial environments.  
This project integrates **Arduino R4 WiFi**, **SHT35**, and **Air Quality sensors (MQ135)** to collect real-time data on temperature, humidity, and air quality.  
The system computes a **Comfort Index**, transmits data to **ThingSpeak**, stores it in **MySQL**, and visualizes live metrics on **Grafana dashboards**.  
It also includes a predictive alert module powered by **Machine Learning (Random Forest)** to detect anomalies before they occur.

## Project Overview

The **Smart Comfort Index Monitoring and Alert System (SCIMAS)** was developed as part of the *EGT209 Data Engineering Project* at **Nanyang Polytechnic, Singapore**.  
It aims to provide smart insights into indoor environmental quality within factories and improve worker well-being through IoT, data engineering, and analytics.

  Data transmitted wirelessly and stored in the cloud for real-time access.

- **Database Management (MySQL)**  
  Structured data storage for long-term analysis and trend visualization.

- **Visualization (Grafana Dashboard)**  
  Dynamic dashboards display live comfort index trends and threshold alerts.

-  **Predictive Analytics (Python & ML)**  
  Machine learning model predicts comfort index anomalies using Random Forest.

- **Alert System**  
  Automatic alerts when comfort or air quality exceeds defined thresholds.

## 🧮 Comfort Index Formula

The **Comfort Index (CI)** is computed based on environmental readings:

\[
\text{CI} = 0.4 \times (\text{Temperature}) + 0.3 \times (\text{Humidity}) + 0.3 \times (100 - \text{Air Quality Score})
\]

Where:
- CI below 50 → ❄️ *Cold / Poor Comfort*  
- CI between 50–75 → 🌤️ *Moderate Comfort*  
- CI above 75 → ☀️ *High Comfort / Warm Environment*
